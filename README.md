# MAX REMY DEV - PORTFOLIO

My clean and minimal portfolio [maxremy.dev](https://maxremy.dev/) built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, using **Shadcn/UI** and **Framer Motion** for smooth UI. Fully self-hosted on my own **AWS** infrastructure: **Amplify** for the frontend, **Strapi CMS** on **EC2**, and **S3 + CloudFront** for scalable media delivery.  
Behind the minimalist UI is a solid and production-grade architecture.

## Backend
