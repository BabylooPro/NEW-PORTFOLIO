## Description

This is my personal portfolio built using **Next.js**, leveraging the **App Router** architecture for modern page routing. The portfolio is designed using **TypeScript**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and utilizes **Shadcn/UI** for UI components. **Framer Motion** is employed for animations to provide smooth and engaging visual interactions.

The portfolio uses **Strapi** as a headless CMS and is deployed on **AWS EC2 Linux** to ensure reliable and scalable performance.
